      In the Lake of the Ozarks I <strong>belong</strong>. We arrive at the lake
      and dip our toes into the culture that surrounds us, <br />
      end up tucked away in our room enjoying traditions of our own. I am not
      alone here. I am a sister. I am a daughter. <br />I belong to a secret
      club whose membership I value more than anything.
