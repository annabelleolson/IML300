      In Kismet Kansas I <strong>listen</strong>. Iâ€™m a sponge, ready and able
      to soak up new information. This 367 person town has a lot to say. And so
      I listen. I absorb the lifestyles and stories of relatives I didn't know
      existed. I imagine my father summers here, riding horses and staking
      fences. And I ponder why this place was a highlight of his childhood. 367
      people, a gas station, a post office and a gun shop. And yet a community
      bond so strong I feel drawn to the place even now.
