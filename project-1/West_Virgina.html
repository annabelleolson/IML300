      In West Virginia, I <strong>climb</strong>. I see my father nearing the
      summit and I follow. I climb above rolling smoking hills and look down on
      the town I had slept in the night before. From this new perspective, I see
      things I had neglected to notice before. And suddenly I bumped into my
      father who had stopped his summit ascent to point out to me details below.
