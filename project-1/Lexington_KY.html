      In Lexington Kentucky I am <strong>sent to bed without dinner</strong>.
      <br />The 5 drive from Saint Louis had wiped me out, and I arrived in
      Lexington curled up, fetal like, in the backseat.<br />
      I was barely able to make it to the motel room when we arrived at 8 pm,
      and neglected to take in any of my new surroundings.
