    <p>
      In Wichita KS I’m a <strong>bitch</strong>. <br />
      I am at the boot barn. <br />He finds me size 8’s. <br />He tells me he
      likes the red ones.<br />
      He tells me I look good in the red ones. <br />He tells me I would look
      good with him. <br />
      I laugh, <strong>avoid</strong>, smile, <strong>avoid</strong>, shrug,
      <strong>avoid</strong>. <br />finally I tell him off. <br />
      At the register my father gives his name <br />and he gets commission off
      my red boots. <br />My father has never, and will never, have to be a
      bitch like me. <br />I drive us away.
