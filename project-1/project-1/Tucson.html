    <p>
      In Tucson I am <strong>there</strong>. My father interacts with his
      mother, balancing the role of son and father at the same time. <br />
      Balancing the duties he feels to the miraculous woman that raised him, and
      the duty he feels to his daughter to <br />
      condemn her backwards beliefs and incautious actions. And I strive to
      <em>just be there</em>. I don't define myself at this <br />
      moment as a daughter or granddaughter, but as someone who admires my
      father and is there to support.
