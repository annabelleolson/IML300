[Changing Landscapes](https://annabelleolson.github.io/IML300/project-1/index.html) is an interactive web experience that takes you along a cross country road trips that symbolizes maturation.

### Description

This is an interactive web journey that takes users on the road with me, as I experience the non-linear process of entering adulthood during a cross country road trip with my father and sister. The visual style or concept of the piece is a road that a user follows from place to place. By clicking different hyperlinks, users are able to visit the different locations along my road trip route. I chose to make the hyperlinks the locations we visited on the trip to emphasize the importance of going to unknown places and having new experiences, all while traveling with people you love and care about. I think this is very metaphorical of the process of entering adulthood; you visit new places and have new experiences but always carry with you the love and lessons you learned from your parents and family. 
My work was inspired by Laurel Schwulst’s theory that the web creates unity through different experiences. Schwulst stated that the web is so cool because it's this vast network of people working together and coming in contact with each other in different places, but the WWW still has the underlying sense of authorship. As a user, you are able to choose what you experience and who you experience that with. That's the sensation I wanted to give to users as they travel across the country and through the maturing process with me.
The title, “Changing Landscapes” works to reflect the changing relationship I’m having with my family as I become an adult. I am working to define myself less in relation to my family, and more as an individual. I give the user two options at the beginning of the project and throughout the project to either get in the driver's seat, or the passenger's seat. When you visit places in the driver's seat this represents maturing and having experiences that make you feel more like an adult. When you visit a place while in the passenger's seat, this represents a regression back into childhood, where you let your parent take the wheel and have experiences that make you feel very childish.
The major media elements I used were all my own videos and images. This was important to me because the project, although universal and relatable, is very personal. I used video’s I captured through the windshield and placed them in the middle of the web page in a small rectangular shape to mimic the feeling of driving and looking out through the windshield. I hope you enjoy my work!
