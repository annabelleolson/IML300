          In Jenny Odell’s article, “How to Internet” she explains how the
          internet used to be described as extensions of things we already knew
          like newspapers, address books, and libraries. The notion that the
          internet exists to make certain tasks easier and simpler has now been
          abandoned and the internet has instead changed our whole way of life,
          often making things more complicated. Odell says that she has lost her
          affection for the internet because what she found so cool about it,
          stepping into another real person’s world and forming connections with
          diverse people, has been overrun by mediated interactions and curated
          content. Odell described an interaction she had on an app called Rando
          that allowed strangers to share random pictures with each other. She
          says: “It wasn’t the content of the photo that made the difference; it
          was the idea that a real person had just pressed a button to send this
          photo, and here I was looking at it, into a room, into a life.” Odell
          appreciates the connections the internet can foster between random
          individuals and the sense of empathy that develops from the ability to
          peek into a stranger's world. The lessening existence of apps like
          Rando makes me wonder if people really want to see real life through
          their screens, or if today, screens are considered as a mode of
          escapism. Why is it then that superhero movies are the highest
          grossing films? People want to escape the normality of life that
          surrounds them. Of course the question then is: is this a good thing,
          a healthy thing? And what's the limitation? Certainly people
          disappearing into the fake worlds of screens and curated internet
          content for hours on end is not ideal, but is it okay to enjoy these
          superficial worlds as a momentary vessel of escapism? I would argue
          yes, it is an okay and sometimes very therapeutic response to the
          calamities of real life. But, the true issue is the amount of time
          people ‘escape’ for. The problem is internet algorithms that draw
          people in for hours on end to make more money from advertisements.
          Laurel Schwulst recognizes this in her piece: “My website is a
          shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?”
          when she states: “This web needs to actually work for people instead
          of being powered by a small handful of big corporations—like
          Facebook/Instagram, Twitter, and Google.”Breaks from reality are good
          and healthy but separating oneself for reality for large chunks of
          time is dangerous to both the individual and society. What needs to
          change in the infrastructure of the web is user-friendly platforms
          that allow for both escapism and connection without usings user’s
          psychology against them to keep them online for hours.
