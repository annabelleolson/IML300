          In Jenny Odell’s article, “How to Internet” she explains how the
          internet used to be described as extensions of things we already knew
          like newspapers, address books, and libraries. The notion that the
          internet exists to make certain tasks easier and simpler has now been
          abandoned and the internet has instead changed our whole way of life,
          often making things more complicated. Odell says that she has lost her
          affection for the internet because what she found so cool about it,
          stepping into another real person’s world and forming connections with
          diverse people, has been overrun by mediated interactions and curated
          content. Odell described an interaction she had on an app called Rando
          that allowed strangers to share random pictures with each other. She
          says: “It wasn’t the content of the photo that made the difference; it
          was the idea that a real person had just pressed a button to send this
          photo, and here I was looking at it, into a room, into a life.” Odell
          appreciates the connections the internet can foster between random
          individuals and the sense of empathy that develops from the ability to
          peek into a stranger's world. The lessening existence of apps like
          Rando makes me wonder if people really want to see real life through
          their screens, or if today, screens are considered as a mode of
          escapism. Why is it then that superhero movies are the highest
          grossing films? People want to escape the normality of life that
          surrounds them. Of course the question then is: is this a good thing,
          a healthy thing? And what's the limitation? Certainly people
          disappearing into the fake worlds of screens and curated internet
          content for hours on end is not ideal, but is it okay to enjoy these
          superficial worlds as a momentary vessel of escapism? I would argue
          yes, it is an okay and sometimes very therapeutic response to the
          calamities of real life. But, the true issue is the amount of time
          people ‘escape’ for. The problem is internet algorithms that draw
          people in for hours on end to make more money from advertisements.
          Laurel Schwulst recognizes this in her piece: “My website is a
          shifting house next to a river of knowledge. What could yours be?”
          when she states: “This web needs to actually work for people instead
          of being powered by a small handful of big corporations—like
          Facebook/Instagram, Twitter, and Google.”Breaks from reality are good
          and healthy but separating oneself for reality for large chunks of
          time is dangerous to both the individual and society. What needs to
          change in the infrastructure of the web is user-friendly platforms
          that allow for both escapism and connection without usings user’s
          psychology against them to keep them online for hours.

          What stuck out to me the most about this week's readings/viewings is
          the speed of our consumption of digital information. With the web at
          our fingertips, we have access to and are exposed to so much
          information, documentation, and works of arts in a single swipe
          through our feed. The amount of media we can consume through the
          digital world far surpasses the amount of which we can retain and
          fully understand. Of course no person can have a full understanding of
          every work they encounter throughout their life, and that is okay.
          But, I worry about the exponential rate at which consumption is
          excelling. Every day I see infographics posted on social media about
          urgent social issues, and the next day I see brand new ones about
          entirely different issues. The graphics from the day before disappear
          (in an immediate extent) from my digital realm, and thus the cause
          they fought for disappeared to some extent from my consciousness,
          altogether replaced with something new. Much of the digital realm’s
          works disappears, as Lara Baladi put it, into the internet's
          “bottomless pit of information.” That's why both Lara Baladi and Paul
          Soulellis see archiving as both an act or resistance and a
          responsibility for the future. Baladi and Soulellis have approached
          archiving the digital world in different ways. Baldi created a website
          that is a collection of revolutionary footage and information related
          to the 2011 Egyptian revolution, and Soulellis focuses on pulling
          works out of the digital realm and into print to preserve them. Both
          of these actions, however, work in resistance to historical erasers
          and traditional power structures. As Soulellis points out, there can
          be a slowness to urgency. Often urgent social change requires a
          patient maintenance of the cause to build and work towards better
          future worlds. Both Baladi and Soulellis practice archiving as
          preservation of past and current resistances to build a platform from
          which positive change can grow. I believe this is important because
          preserving today's resistance protects its eraser tomorrow.

          The thing that stuck out to me the most about this week's reading was
          UX designers' capacity to drastically influence users. UX designers
          jobs are to create seamless, easy to use, pleasurable experiences for
          users on the web. What Olia Lialina brings up is that this process of
          distancing the user from the actual programing, algorithms, and
          hardware that make up computers and interfaces, confines and removes
          autonomy from users. The role of “experience” is to hide
          programmability and customizability of the system, to minimize and
          direct the users’ interaction with the system. As user’s gain less
          certainty of what they are actually doing with their computers, the
          more susceptible they become to designer’s scripting. Experience
          design prevents users from thinking and valuing computers as
          computers, “It makes us helpless. We lose the ability to narrate
          ourselves.” Advanced experiences and seamless interfaces may seem like
          victories and progress, but really, they are driving people to be more
          oblivious and less competent.

          What I found positive about this week's viewings and reading was how
          code can be used to connect people, share ideas, and make people feel
          welcome. I liked how Lauren McCarthy approached her talk by first
          defining what it is like to “feel at home,” and then explained how
          that feeling influenced her development of p5js. She and the other
          creators set out to make a space where people feel comfortable with
          the systems and with each other. A platform where all people are
          welcomed and feel safe to learn and create. Though I found McCarthy’s
          description about P5js and expanding web accessibility uplifting and
          interesting, I found the discussion of surveillance in this week's
          viewings to be quite terrifying. In particular, Heather
          Dewey-Hagborg’s art project that built 3D models of people’s faces
          based on the genetic information from random samples collected in
          Brooklyn, made me uneasy. I thought the art project unearthed the
          invasive possibilities that advanced biotechnology allows for, and
          opened up an important discussion that needed to be had about genetic
          privacy. Heather stated that the work is meant to draw viewers into a
          critique about the potential of emerging biosurveillance, the media
          coverage that the work received completed the work, she said, by
          getting massive engagement and questioning of the technology and
          processes of biosurveillance. Heather states that Genetic privacy laws
          are being discussed and decided right now, so it is paramount for
          people to question and critique biosurveillance. She says that if an
          artist’s work with found DNA troubles you, imagine what could happen
          if it gets into the wrong hands? Now is the time to question if we
          want projects like Heather’s to be legal, and what role this
          technology might play in our legal system? With the ability to know
          things like gender, ancestry, health, eye color, skin color, face
          shape, tendencies for things like depression/aggression, could this
          biosurveillance be used to target and marginalize certain groups of
          people. Could it condemn a person before a crime has even been
          committed, just based on natural tendencies? This ties into the
          reading, “Everyone Watches, Nobody Sees: How Black Women Disrupt
          Surveillance Theory'' by Sydette Harry. Which states that black
          cultural surveillance has often led to “appropriation, clumsy
          “admiration”, and willful erasure”. If biosurveillance gains
          popularity it could be used to target and marginalize black people and
          other minority groups in the same way the cultural surveillance has
          done for years. It is time to educate ourselves and make policy
          regarding biosurveillance so it is not allowed to be utilized in an
          unchecked manner that could potentially stereotype and target people.

          Rosa Menkman, in her Glitch Studies Manifesto, Xiao Mina in her talk
          on meme culture, and Hito Steyerl in her chapter “In Defense of the
          Poor Image,” are grasping at the idea that the systems and norms in
          place today that we blindly accept as the environments to create art
          and share content may not be the most well developed or equitable
          spaces available. They see changes in media conventions and
          environments as attainable and possibly necessary for a better
          technological and cultural future. Steyerl states that poor images
          reflect an idea that is circulated and remixed, that changes
          resolution, and often loses names and credits along the way, but
          reflects the conditions of different cultures and times. Steyerl
          states that the poor image is in short, “about reality.” This relates
          heavily to Xiao Mina’s speech about meme culture, in which she
          explains that memes reflect a larger cultural narrative and are based
          on and add to our cultural history. She also states that memes can be
          looked at as affirmation superhighways because they work to affirm the
          political and social beliefs of the time through digital connection
          and resistance. Steyerl states the ethic of remix, whether this be to
          a meme or poor image, increases participation and inclusion of a
          plethora of voices. Although the democratization of media can work to
          diminish the elitist culture of images, Styler warns that poor images
          are popular images and can be used to advance positive and negative
          agendas. Mina sees the social media environment in a similar way,
          stating that digital social movement must navigate a world of
          dissensus. She says that ​​movements of hate and activism use similar
          techniques and memes to project different agendas, often learning from
          each other about how to influence society. She pressures her audience
          to imagine an environment where memes could spread and inspire people
          around the world without causing so much division and being limited to
          the scope of certain online echo chambers. In the same way that Mina
          questions social media platforms, Menkman questions the social
          construct of “good” resolution. She sees resolution as conformity and
          glitches as providing a shift away from ordinary that inspires a
          moment of awe. In its simplest definition Menkman sees a glitch as an
          act of breaking protocol. All three artists and theorists pressure
          their audiences to break from the conventions of media to create more
          original art and more socially productive modes of connection.

          Mimi Onuoha and Joy Buolamwini talk about how aspects of our
          identities, due to data collection, can be summed up and utilized for
          a plethora of reasons. Buolamwini points out algorithmic bias and
          gives them a name: the coded gaze. This kind of bias can travel
          extremely quickly and established norms can become entrenched with
          ease, often without the user’s or programer’s awareness that they are
          promoting inequity and biases. Machine learning with entrenched biases
          are becoming huge tools used to make decisions in our everyday lives.
          We must make sure to factor in fairness as we code, and remain aware
          of the implication of our code. The data gathered can be used to
          promote discrimination and can be collected in a biased way. We must
          think about how we code and who we code for instead of having social
          progress and diversity of applications of code be an afterthought.
          Stephanie Dinkins, in her essay “Afro-now-ism,” sums this up well by
          arguing that we as coders, artists, and architects of the future, must
          display social consciousness. We must remain conscious of the
          implications of our work and of how it will affect diverse users.

          The collections of readings and talks this week focused on the digital
          systems that facilitate digital trauma, digital colonialism, and the
          reduction of personhood through data collection and the usage of that
          data. Yaa Addae, in her article “ Digital Doulas Take Restorative
          Justice to Cyberspace,” states that digital infrastructures are
          created to “exploit, categorize and discard personhood.” She states
          that these systems limit human potential for growth. Olivia McKayla
          shares this view and presents a counter-practice that she calls
          “non-violent creative code” that focuses on creating while
          acknowledging not disturbing the people, land, and cultural contexts
          that makes an artists work possible. Morehshin Allahyari created a
          piece with this practice of nonviolent creation in mind. Her 2015
          project “Material Speculation: ISIS” created 3D printed artifacts that
          were destroyed by ISIS. But when doing this, she remained mindful of
          the implication of taking something from the middle east that was
          destroyed and rebuilding and repositioning it in London, New York, or
          the internet (a western driven platform). With this in mind she looked
          at her artifacts as time capsules that held the information of the
          process of creation for future generations. This open sourcing of her
          work focuses on making them accessible to all, and not simply a stolen
          cultural object that is exploited and reclaimed by the west. New
          technology, like the 3D modeling and printing systems that Allahyari
          utilized for her work can save histories and cultures, but they can
          also be used to expand colonialism in new ways. Allahyari views
          anything that does not provide free access to the data and models used
          to create historical artifacts as digital colonialism. It is a
          reclaiming of culture that is designed for a narrow audience; it is
          exploitation.

          This week's readings have caused me to think more critically about how
          we view technology and programs. Often, we tend to categorize
          technology as the antithesis of human. It collects data and outputs
          data without any emotion or thought. This can lead people to believe
          that technology is thus objective and unbiased. However this is far
          from the truth. Technology is built and programmed by people for
          people. Often the people who build the program and the people they
          intend the program to be used by (consciously or subconsciously) are
          not a diverse or inclusive group. Ari Melenciano, in her talk,
          highlights her commitment as a designer and educator to question the
          status quo of design, and reimagined what is the role of a designer?
          She states that design has been looked at through an industrialized
          and capitalist mindset as a tool that can make a lot of money fast.
          Its rapid production and profits are often more important than
          considering the implication of that technology or questioning if it is
          exploitive. Melenciano argues for more human centered design asking:
          why are we creating boundaries between human and non human? She
          suggests that we should encourage more ecological centered design. She
          also highlights the importance of moving from being technologically
          reactionary to being more visionary, to thinking ahead to have more
          sustainable and long lasting change. In her project “The Revolution
          Will be Digitized” she studied past patterns of revolution and looked
          at the ways technology had been involved in movements, then used
          speculative design and created a manifesto for an equitable
          techno-culture future. Ari Melenciano believes the revolution will be
          digitized but is still focused on education, and the reform of
          technological systems. Hamid Khan, an activist for dismantling racist
          police algorithms, on the other hand, argues that reform will not
          work. He believes technology enables racism in policing because the
          data inputted is racist and thus racist data is produced. LAPD Police
          surveillance has been used to stalk and target minorities, Khan states
          “it's a tool of biased social control.” However technology is not the
          problem, Khan argues, technology is just a continuation of the history
          of surveillance.Their have always been groups of people deemed suspect
          and subjected to extra attention. Kahn’s goal is to dismantle the
          system, not reform it. Things won’t get better, just worse with
          technology, says Kahn. He believes that racism and bias is so deeply
          ingrained in our social and cultural systems that technological
          remedies and reform will not work,it will simply reflect the racist
          structures already in place. He believes we need a total revolution
          and restructuring of our society.
